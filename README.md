<br>
Welcome to "Fork, Commit, Merge"!<br>A project designed to help you familiarize yourself with the open source contribution workflow on GitHub, as well as to help you learn the basics of programming in different languages.

</div>

## Quick Start

1. Go to [Setup Instructions](#setup-instructions) and follow the instructions about how to start working with the project.
1. Go to [Tasks](#tasks) and choose a task you want to work on. You can find instructions for installing the required tools for each task in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).
1. Go to [Submitting Your Changes](#submitting-your-changes) and follow the instructions about how to submit your changes.

## Prerequisites

### Installing an IDE

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that consolidates basic tools required for software testing and development. An IDE typically consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Some IDEs, like Android Studio or Visual Studio, even offer more advanced features such as version control, databases, cloud services, and more. Why use an IDE? Using an IDE can significantly speed up the development process by offering a variety of tools and features under one roof.

Here are a few reasons why developers use IDEs:

-   Efficiency: With everything in one place, developers can write, test, and debug code without needing to switch between different tools.

-   Code Assistance: Many IDEs offer features like autocompletion, syntax highlighting, and suggestions, making the code-writing process smoother.

-   Integrated Debugging: Integrated debuggers allow developers to test and debug their programs within the IDE, speeding up the development cycle.

-   Extensions & Plugins: Most modern IDEs support a wide range of extensions and plugins, enabling developers to customize their environment and add even more functionalities.

We recommend using VS Code as your IDE for this project. It's free, open-source, and supports a wide range of languages and extensions. You can download it from the [VS Code - Official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). However, if you prefer to use another IDE, that's fine too!

Instructions of how to install an IDE that suits for you can be found in our website at [forkcommitmerge.io/ide](https://forkcommitmerge.io/ide)!
